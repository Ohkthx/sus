# SchiNET User Server

---

SchiNET User Server, SUS, is a server designed to interface with various chat services to create a text-driven multiplayer role-playing experience. 

Mechanics that are heavily inspired by Ultima Online, SUS aims to give the on-the-go satisfaction to participants who wish to actively participate in their communities. 

So with that said big thank you to the maintainers of [ServUO](https://github.com/ServUO/ServUO) and [RunUO](https://github.com/runuo/runuo) for being open-sourced and providing amazing references to implementing similar mechanics.
